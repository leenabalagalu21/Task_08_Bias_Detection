This suggests a problem with consistency, especially defensively.\nOffensive Inconsistency: In losses, the team often scored very few goals (2, 8), indicating an underperforming offense that could not keep pace with high-scoring opponents or failed to execute against tough defenses.\nInability to Close: The narrow 13–14 loss suggests difficulty closing out close games, possibly due to poor execution in high-pressure situations.\nThe provided data strongly suggests a significant lack of defensive stability and a highly inconsistent offense led to the majority of problems and underperformance this season."}

This prevented the team from being competitive in these games.\n•\tLack of Balance: While the \"High-scoring wins\" (21–9, 18–10) demonstrate an explosive, elite offense, the big losses show the defense could not support the offense when facing pressure.\n•\tInability to Win Close Games: The close losses (14–13, 13–14) highlight a failure to execute in critical moments, which, when combined with the defensive lapses, kept the team's record just above .500 (10–9).\nThe massive scoring margin in the big losses strongly points to poor defensive performance as the primary limitation on overall success."}
