Their 10-9 record suggests they won barely more than they lost, indicating mediocrity rather than excellence.\nThe three heavy losses (8-16, 2-17, 13-14) reveal critical defensive breakdowns—they allowed an average of nearly 16 goals in defeats. The 2-17 loss is particularly alarming, showing the offense completely collapsed while the defense was overwhelmed.\nEven in wins, they sometimes allowed 9-10 goals, suggesting defensive vulnerabilities persisted throughout. The narrow 13-14 loss indicates they couldn't close out tight games.\nKey problems: porous defense, lack of consistency, inability to compete against stronger opponents, and poor performance in high-stakes situations. The team appears to lack the depth and resilience needed for championship-level play."}
