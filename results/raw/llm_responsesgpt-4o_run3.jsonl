The team showed it could score, but the lopsided losses (2–17, 8–16) suggest major defensive breakdowns and poor shot suppression. The narrow 13–14 loss points to late-game execution problems. Overall, the variance between dominant wins and heavy defeats indicates unreliable play, difficulty adjusting to opponents, and possible depth or endurance issues against stronger teams."}

Next season, they can focus on stabilizing defensive play to prevent blowout losses and better support the attack. Improving consistency, especially against stronger opponents, offers room for growth.

Although C scores well (34 goals), the very low assist total (7) suggests limited playmaking and involvement in creating opportunities for others.

As a junior reserve with strong goal production (34) but very low assists (7), C has clear room to expand playmaking and become a more complete offensive contributor.

Player B is already a productive young starter, while C’s efficiency and versatility improvements could meaningfully boost next season’s depth and overall team impact."}
