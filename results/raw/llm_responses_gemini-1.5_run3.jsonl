This suggests significant defensive failures in key matchups.\nInability to Win Close Games: The 13–14 loss indicates difficulty in closing out competitive matches.\nOverall Inconsistency: A 10–9 record suggests the team was only marginally better than average, failing to establish dominance despite strong offensive wins (21–9, 18–10). The vast goal differentials (both wins and losses) point to major fluctuations in performance.\nThe goal difference in losses is the most immediate problem area identified.\nWould you like to know the name of the team that defeated Syracuse 17–2?\nThe $2-17$ loss was to No. 2 Boston College on April 17, 2025. It marked a program low at the time, as the 15-goal deficit was their worst in 20 years, and two goals was the fewest they had ever scored in a game."}
