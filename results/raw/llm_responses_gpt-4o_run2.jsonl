To improve, they should focus on closing out close games, particularly with better defense and composure in tight situations (e.g., 13–14 loss). Enhancing defensive consistency could prevent large scoring margins in losses (2–17, 8–16). Capitalizing on strong performances against weaker opponents can build confidence, and focusing on improving transition play and ball control in close games would be key. With improved focus on defense and mental toughness, they could convert more losses into wins next season."}

Their high-scoring wins show the offense was capable, but the wide variability in goals allowed points directly to inconsistent defensive performance."}
