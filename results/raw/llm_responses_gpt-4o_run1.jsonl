Close losses like 13–14 suggest difficulty finishing tight games.

Improving consistency—especially maintaining scoring output against tougher defenses—could turn close losses into wins. Strengthening defensive schemes to avoid blowout gaps (like the 16- and 17-goal concessions) would greatly boost overall competitiveness. With a 10–9 record, small gains in shot selection, transition efficiency, and late-game execution could shift the season trajectory significantly next year."}
